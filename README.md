# FSD_Portfolio
Portfolio project for Full Stack Developer Nanodegree

Simple website that follows the mockup file. 

Differences with the mockup:
- Placeholder images are used instead of real ones
- App captions are not centered
- Website is only 800 pixels wide, so possibly smaller than the intended one
